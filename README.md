Doh Press
=========

The fun way to obfuscate your Javascript

Premise
=======

Lots of developer tools do great things, useful things, very quickly. They do things that let us get our job done,
and become a core part of our workflow.

One such tool is the obfuscator. In the absence of packaging systems on the web, Javascript coders who write for the web
leave their source code to the mercy of pirates and hackers, who may wish to use that code for their own purpose without
permission, or worse, use it to break whatever systems you've worked so hard to build.

Obfuscators are a necessary tool for many web businesses, such as Aphelio. We want to make our experiences as open and acessible
to the end user as possible, but we also need to protect our technologies for the safety of our users and our hard work.

For a while we had been using an obfuscator script, executed from the Javascript Console while browsing a psuedo webpage.
It would easily obfuscate the file we gave it, we could even specify how complex we wanted it to be.

However we have to remember how to use a lot of console tools, and things can get a bit messy. In fact, using all of these
command line tools and stuff may make us look cool in front of our boss, but it actually get's pretty tedious and dull.

Doh Press is a beautiful GUI based obfuscator, that lets us obfuscate our code in a fun and hassle free way.
